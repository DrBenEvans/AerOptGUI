AerOpt_InputParameters: Input parameters for an optimisation
			In particular,
			IV%NoCN = number of control nodes
			IV%xrange = control point x boundary coordinates in format "minimumx maximumx"
			IV%yrange = control point y boundary coordinates in format "minimumy maximumy"
			IV%NoNests = number of agents
			IV%NoG = number of generations
Control_Nodes: Coordinates of control points in format: "X	Y"

profilePoints: Initial profile that is being optimised. E.g. NACA0024 or NACA21120
Fitness_0: Fitness of initial profile
FitnessAll: Fitness of each agent in each generation in format "generationNumber     Ag1     ...	Agn"
