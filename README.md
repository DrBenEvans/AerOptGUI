# The AerOpt GUI

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Compiling statically with Docker
If you are compiling on windows the new recommended way of compiling the AerOpt GUI is to use Docker to create a Docker
container based of the included DockerFile "DockerFile.mxe". This has been setup to create a single
executable with all the QT libraires built into it. Docker is a tool to run lightweight virtual machines
(docker call these containers) to perform specific tasks. In our case this has been configured to run a minimal
install of ubuntu linux which has been setup with a static build of QT and the tools nessacary to crosscompile AerOpt GUI for windows. 

This may seem quite a roundabout way of achiving this, since is it is possible to build QT staically for windows.
However, this process is far from easy as it fraught with errors. The interested reader can a find decent set of
instructions [here](https://tadeubento.com/2020/qt-static-builds-under-windows/). However, I will warn you now
this is not for the faint hearted.

If you don't wish to (or can't) use Docker you can follow the instructions under **Compiling in QT Creator**
to compile a dynamically linked executable with QT creator. You will then however, need to perform some extra
steps to distribute the executable. See **Deploying** for details.

### Setup

First you will need to install git, if you don't already have it. Go to the [git for Windows home page]
(https://gitforwindows.org/) and click download.

Next download docker desktop for [windows](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and install it with the default settings.

Windows will ask you to reboot after which docker will automatcally start running once you log back in. If you don't want 
this behaviour you can change this in the settings however, you need to remember to start docker whenever you want to re-compile
the code. 

Note: docker may throw an error saying WSL2 Instaltion is incomplete. If this occurs you need to 
download the WSL2 kernal from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel) and install it.

At this point there is a tutorial, which you can go through if you wish (or you can press the skip button in the bottom left corner) 
after which you can close docker.

Next, we need to download the AerOpt GUI repo. Since you have git we can use microsoft powershell to clone the project.
Open the start menu and search for `Powershell` this will open a blue textbox with white writing, This is called a comand prompt.
 
If you are familiar with it, use `cd` to navigate to where you want to download the repo. If not, you probably want to place it 
in your home folder (generally this is 'C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME'), which is where you start.

Copy the following commands in to the command prompt and press Enter
```
git clone https://github.com/DrBenEvans/AerOptGUI
cd AerOptGUI
```

The next step is to build the docker image. We can think of this as a template (created using the commands defined by Dockerfile.mxe)
that will be used to create a linux virtual machine (docker calls this a container).

The image is setup to create a basic linux instalation along with QT and and all the tools we need to compile the code.
We can create the image with with the following command. 

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.mxe -t qt/mxe:win64 .
```

Warning this command can take several hours to complete depending on your computer and network connection as it has to fetch and 
compile a of lot diferent of tools (fortunatley it is only required to be run once). 

### Compiling the code
Once this is complete we now have a docker image we can use to create a container with the following command.

```
docker run -it -v ${pwd}:/AerOptGUI --name QT-build qt/mxe:win64
```

This command should place us on a command prompt inside the container we just created. You can tell because the prompt should say:
"root@xyz123/:#" where xyz123 will be a series of random letters and numbers.

From here we simply need to run the following to compile the code.

```
	cd /AerOptGUI/
	unzip docker_libssh.zip
	cd docker_libssh
	cp libssh.a /opt/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/lib/libssh.a
	cp -r libssh /opt/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/include/libssh
	cd ..
	qmake GeneticGui-docker.pro
	make
```

Once finished we can stop the container with the command 
```
	exit
```
You should now have a static executable AerOptGUI.exe in the release directory. At this pont If you ever need to re-compile
the code you can simply run the following in powershell to restart the container.
```
docker start -i QT-build
```
Then inside the container simply run:

```
cd /AerOptGUI
qmake GeneticGui-docker.pro
make clean
make
```

Finally, if you want to delete the container simply run the following in Powershell:

```
docker rm -f QT-build
```

Or if you want to remove the image you can run:

```
docker image rm -f qt/mxe:win64
```

Note: you will need to re-run the docker build command if you do this and then want to re-build
again at a later date. Since this, as discussed earlier this can take several hours we advice caution when doing this.

At this point you have everything you need. What follows are the old instructions to compile dynamically with QT creator
should you wish to use it.

## Compiling in QT Creator

### Install Compilation Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
The recommended way of compiling the AerOpt GUI is using the QT Creator IDE.
>>>>>>> fc85bcc3edf634aa789cbc9675ff561c8f4c36cf
You can download the IDE on the [QT website](https://www.qt.io/download).
Choose the open source option and download the installer.
In the installer, you will need to create a QT account if you don't already have one.
When selecting components, check the latest version of QT and 64 bit version of MinGW.

You will also need the ssh and ssl libraries.
On Windows, we recommend using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for this.
First you will need to install [git](https://gitforwindows.org/), if you don't already have it.
Go to the [git for Windows home page](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click download.

After installing git, you should also have a program called `Git Bash`.
Run it to open a command line interface. If you are familiar with it, use `cd`
to navigate where you want to install vcpkg.
If not, you probably want to install it in your home folder, which is where you start.

Copy the following commands in to the command line and press Enter to execute
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```
For later convenience, you may want to execute the following line as well.
Windows will ask for admin access.
```
./vcpkg integrate install
```

Now you can install libraries. You are already in the correct folder, but once you
close the window and open a new one, you will need to run
```
cd vcpkg
```
to get back.
Now install `libssh`, `openssl` and `zlib` with the following command
```
./vcpkg install libssh:x64-windows openssl:x64-windows zlib:x64-windows
```

Next, open `System Properties` in the start menu, and press enter.
Click `Environment Variables`, find `path` in the second panel and double click.
Add the following three lines as separate entries
```
C:\Users\USERNAME\vcpkg\packages\libssh_x64-windows\bin
C:\Users\USERNAME\vcpkg\packages\openssl-windows_x64-windows\bin
C:\Users\USERNAME\vcpkg\packages\zlib_x64-windows\bin
```
replacing `USERNAME` with your actual user name. For this change to take effect, you may need to reboot.

Note that if you installed `vcpkg` in a custom location, you need to change the paths accordingly.

### Setup Project

Next, download the AerOpt GUI. Since you have git, you can use it to clone the project. Open `Git Bash` and run the command
```
git clone https://github.com/DrBenEvans/AerOptGUI.git
```

Open QT Creator, click `Open Project` and open `AerOptGUI\GeneticGui.pro`, which should now be in your home directory.
The first time you do this the IDE will ask you about the configuration.
Choose the latest 64 bit MinGW version and click `configure`.

Next, open `GeneticGui.pro` in the editor and scroll to the bottom.
You will see several lines including the path
```
C:\Users\USERNAME\src\vcpkg...
```
Replace `USERNAME` with your username on each line. If `vcpkg` is in a custom location, use that path instead.

### Setup on the Cluster

The AerOpt GUI depends on a specific version of the AerOpt tool on the cluster.
You can use git to get the newest version.
Log on to the cluster and run
```
mv AerOpt AerOpt-old
git clone https://github.com/DrBenEvans/AerOpt.git
```

Compile the new version of AerOpt
```
module load mpi
cd AerOpt/source
make all
ls -s AerOpt_v3.5 ../AerOpt
```

You should now be able to run jobs on the cluster using the GUI.


## Deploying

<<<<<<< HEAD
I you followed the docker instructions the compiled executable you created can be distributed without needing any additional libraries or tools. 
However, if you compiled the code dynamically using QT creator you will need to do some extra work.

There are two deployed releases in [Jarno's github page](https://github.com/rantahar/AerOpt-gui/releases). All you need to do to run this version
of AerOpt is to donwload AerOptGui.zip, extract the file and run AerOptGui.exe in the new folder. This is much easier for a user than compiling 
QT statically.

To be able to run on a cluster, you also need to download AerOpt.tar.gz
on the cluster.
```
mv AerOpt AerOpt_backup
wget https://github.com/rantahar/AerOpt-gui/releases/download/0.2/AerOpt.tar.gz
tar -xvf AerOpt.tar.gz
```

This is much easier for a user than compiling the whole thing.
>>>>>>> fc85bcc3edf634aa789cbc9675ff561c8f4c36cf

To create a new release compile the program using `release` setting in QT Creator.
This is above the play symbol on the bottom left in QT Creator 4.9.
When you compile the program, an executable called `AerOptGui.exe` is created in the same directory the AerOptGui folder is in.

Download the [zip archive](https://github.com/rantahar/AerOpt-gui/releases/download/0.2/AerOptGui.zip) and extract it.
The folder contains everything AerOptGui needs to run.
Replace `AerOptGui.exe` with the newly compiled executable and it should work directly.
